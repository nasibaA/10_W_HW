    "Dot Product is a fundamental way we can combine two vectors. Intuitively, it tell us something about how much two vectors point in the same direction. dot product represent with \"$ \\bullet $\" opperation between the two vectors(pronounced \"a dot b\"): And dot product give us the scaler number (not a new vector numbers ).\n",
